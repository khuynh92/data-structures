# Data Structures and Algorithms

### Purpose
This repository is to practice data structures, along with test driven development using Jest.

### How to install
npm is required to run the tests on this project. if you do not have npm, visit the npm website (link below)

run  the command `npm i` to download the project dependencies.

### View Tests

run the command `npm test` to view test acceptance and coverage.

## Data Structures

### Binary Search Trees
-----------------------

example of the structure of the binary tree

```
root Node {
  val: 5,
  right: Node {
    val: 10,
    left: null,
    right: null,
  },
  left: Node {
    val: 2,
    left: null,
    right: null,
  }
}
```

#### methods

- `.insert(value)`

Inserts a new node into the binary search tree

#### additional functions

- `isBST(binary search tree)`  

Checks if a binary tree is a binary search tree.

__output__

- __*must input a binary tree*__ if input is not a binary tree
- __*false*__ if input is not a binary search tree
- __*true*__ if input is a binary search tree
